**Walnut-Tree** is a self-initiated personal brand designed to showcase multiple identities—Cinematographer, Computer Science Graduate, and Sports Analyst—under a single unified domain.
Built with Nuxt, enriched by GSAP animations, and enhanced with Three.js 3D scenes, Walnut-Tree delivers a dynamic and immersive storytelling experience across each portfolio route.

✨ **Goal**: Break away from static portfolios and create an interactive, expressive, and identity-driven web experience.

🚀 **Project Vision**

Walnut-Tree is more than a portfolio site—it’s a modular storytelling framework.
The goal is to:

  Present different professional identities under a unified brand

  Use Three.js for unique 3D visuals (camera motion, object transitions, scene reveals)

  Use GSAP for smooth micro-interactions and cinematic animations

  Build a mobile-first, fast, elegant experience with Nuxt

  Provide a template for expanding into additional portfolios in the future

This project evolves continuously as I experiment with new front-end techniques and creative designs.
